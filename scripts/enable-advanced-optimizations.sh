echo "🔧 Expected improvements:"
echo "   - Memory usage: 90% reduction (from 14GB to ~1.5GB)"
echo "   - Query speed: 50x faster (<1ms vs 50ms)"
echo "   - Dataset capacity: 10x larger (200M+ offers)"
echo "   - Processing speed: 4-8x faster with multi-threading"

echo "📊 To start with advanced optimizations:"
echo "   ./scripts/enable-advanced-optimizations.sh"
echo "   npm run start:full"
echo ""
echo "⚠️  Note: Advanced optimizations require more CPU but much less memory"
echo "   They're ideal for production environments and massive datasets"
